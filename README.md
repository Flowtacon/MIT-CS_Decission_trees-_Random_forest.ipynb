# MIT CS: Decision Trees & Random Forest

## Overview

This repository contains educational materials and implementations related to Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms, based on MIT Computer Science curriculum. These are fundamental machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks.

## Topics Covered

### Decision Trees
- Introduction to decision tree algorithms
- Tree construction and splitting criteria
- Information gain and entropy
- Gini impurity
- Pruning techniques
- Overfitting prevention

### Random Forest
- Ensemble learning concepts
- Bootstrap aggregating (Bagging)
- Random feature selection
- Out-of-bag error estimation
- Feature importance
- Hyperparameter tuning
